# Personal webpage

This is my personal webpage where you can find information about myself (resume, social links, etc).

This project is deployed on a Raspberry PI Kubernetes cluster using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

You can read about it [in this article](https://medium.com/@tdr.popa/ci-cd-on-a-raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-f8f22610d4eb).

The site uses the Aerial theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

## How to run

You have to run a `yarn install` first. After that each push on the master branch will bump the version (patch it).
